## General Info

* Fatkid has his own [route](https://pastebin.com/tA9ctBgw) that is (most likely) faster but uses Ken & Metis so it sucks
* Voices on w/ Auto Advance is apparently faster (thanks fatkid)
* I don't use Tactics Memory, but it's personal preference
* The Answer has no compendium so most of your time save is going to come from adapting the fusion route on the fly based on what shuffle time personas you get
* Generally in shuffle time: Persona >= Wands > Equipment
  * Which is better between Persona & Wands is completely situational
  * Shuffle time can be forced by ending on MC's turn or finishing with an AoA
  * Money & Cup are basically useless
  * You should probably practice doing fights with party members and always ending on MC's turn
* You'll want to scan 99% of enemies & bosses
  * The other 1% are enemies with "Counter" skills that you want the party members to attack
  * Even if you can't see the weakness of bosses, your party members can
* Don't be afraid to use most items
  * You want to avoid using Mirrors of any kind
  * A good number of Somas & Precious Eggs are basically required for the final fights but don't be too stingy with them
  * Bead Chains are really good for a quick "Oh shit" heal
* Other than the necessary accessories & 1 routed armor upgrade shopping & equipment upgrades are up to you
  * You want a good number of "Dis-" items & Me Patra Gems
  * You'll need an increasingly large amount of Revival Beads later on
  * Medical Powders are really good for conserving SP during grinds
* There are 3 methods of getting shadows to turn around
  * The fastest way is to climb stairs after aggroing it
  * The 2nd fastest way is to run far enough away to deaggro (far enough that it doesn't show up on the minimap)
  * The absolute slowest way is to open and close the triangle menu before aggroing them
    * Avoid doing this whenever possible (unless you have to menu anyways)
* There is a period of time after leaving a battle where shadows won't see you, use this to your advantage
* Quick inputs during battle that are useful
  * L1: Brings up scan
  * R1: Brings up turn order
  * Square: Pass turn
  * Circle: Jump to Basic Attack in menu
  * Circle -> Down -> X: Quick open skill menu
* Official Speedrun.comâ„¢ sanctioned timing starts on Power On and ends on the final cutscene skip before the credits

Equip 

* Aigis with Agni Bracers
* Yukari with Vayu Bracers
* Mitsuru with Varuna Bracers

Try to buy more Magic Mirrors here if you can

Take Yukari, Akihiko, & Mitsuru

### Conceited Maya & Jotun of Bloods

* Manage tactics depending on turn order
* Scan the Maya then the Jotuns when they appear
* Turn 1: Throw a Magic Mirror
* Goal is to do just under 500 damage before going all in (Yukari + Mitsuru -dyning once should work)
* Manage tactics to go all in after it's turn
* It should only summon 1 Jotun if you get the full 2+ rounds of -Dynes and Ragnoraks
* Swap everyone to Heal/Support and Poison Mist the Jotun 
* Throw additional mirrors as needed

## Empyrean

Fuse these if you can but you can do them after Cyclops & Seekers too:

> Atropos/Hecatoncheires/Hell Biker x Succubus = Chernobog (Heart Item)
>
> Jatayu x Throne = Odin
>
> > Growth 3

Fuse one of these:

> Titania x Kumbhanda = Melchizedek
>
> Decaraiba x Kikuri-Hime/Atropos = Melchizedek
>
> Kikuri-Hime x Barong = Melchizedek
>
> Raphael x Kurama Tengu/Kumbhanda = Melchizedek

> Kingu/Barong x Melchizedek = Lilith
>
> > Growth 3

Make sure you have 2/3 Attack Mirrors, grab Yukari, Akihiko, & Mitsuru

Equip Null Wind accessory on Aigis, equip Null Fire accessory on Yukari if you have it

### Rebellious Cyclops & 2 Acheron Seekers

* Put everyone on Heal/Support, swap Akihiko to Knock Down, swap Mitsuru to target whatever she chose to Ice Break
* Scan Seekers -> Cyclops
* Virus Breath -> Attack Mirror -> Maragidyne/Item -> Attack Mirror -> Maragidyne/Item (-> Attack Mirror)
* That should kill the Cyclops, spam Maragidyne/Ragnorak on the Seekers

### Grinding

Grind in Empyrean Section 2 with Akihiko and Mitsuru (bring Yukari if you want extra safety on Erebus)

You can basically spam Chernobog's Mamudoon on most fights

The end goal of this grind is:

> Chernobog's Heart Item
>
> Bishamonten w/ Null Wind, Ragnarok, Fire Boost, Fire Amp
>
> Arahabaki w/ Makarakarn, Tetrakarn, Spell Master

and one of the following

> Titania w/ Bufudyne, Ice Boost, Ice Amp, Resist Fire
>
> Titania w/ Bufudyne, Ice Boost, Ice Amp, Null Fire
>
> Loki w/ Bufudyne, Ice Boost, Ice Amp, Null Fire
>
> Laksmi w/ Bufudyne, Ice Boost, Ice Amp, Resist Fire, Null Dark, Ice Break, (Mediarama)

Aigis should finish grinding at like level 68-70ish

When you learn Spell Master and Makarakarn fuse:

> Thor x Lilith = Hell Biker
