## General Info

* Voices off is apparently [faster](http://ch.nicovideo.jp/calomates/blomaga/ar642669)
* I don't use Tactics Memory, but it's personal preference
* The Answer has no compendium so most of your time save is going to come from adapting the fusion route on the fly based on what shuffle time personas you get
* Generally in shuffle time: Persona >= Wands > Equipment > Money > Cup
  * Which is better between Persona & Wands is completely situational
  * Shuffle time can before by ending on MC's turn or finishing with an AoA
* Grinding with party members is the way to go
  * Grinding solo only awards 43% more exp
  * Having properly leveled party members speeds up grinds & boss fights
  * You probably should practice doing fights with party members and always ending on MC's turn
* You'll want to scan 99% of enemies
  * The other 1% are enemies with "Counter" skills that you want the party members to attack
  * Even if you can't see the weakness of bosses, your party members can
* Don't be afraid to use most items
  * You want to avoid using Mirrors of any kind
  * A good number of Somas & Precious Eggs are basically required for the final fights
  * Bead Chains are really good for a quick "Oh shit" heal
* Other than the necessary accessories & 1 routed armor upgrade shopping & equipment upgrades are up to you
  * You want a good number of "Dis-" items & Me Patra Gems
  * You'll need an increasingly large amount of Revival Beads later on
  * Medical Powders are really good for conserving SP during grinds
* Official Speedrun.comâ„¢ sanctioned timing starts on Power On and ends on the final cutscene skip before the credits
  * [Burn leaderboards](https://twitter.com/AppleCiderRTA/status/1023989914701127680)

>
> > Virus Breath 
> >
> > Masukunda

> [Throne](Throne) x Saki Mitama/Thoth/Hokuto Seikun/Titania = Thor (Heart Item)

Buy 1 Ergo Armor, 3 Kaiser Armor, 1 Titanium Legs, & 3 Assassin's Shoes

You'll also need at least Kingu (Judecca), Lachesis (Ptolomea/Judecca), & Koumokuten (Ptolomea/Judecca) or Rangda (Ptolomea)

* Scan Akihiko & set Metis to Knockdown
* Swap to Odin and use Makarakarn (forces Akihiko to Power Charge -> Gigantic Fist)
* Switch to Thor before Akihiko's attack to null it
* Revive/Ziodyne on Thor turns
* Thunder Reign/Ragnarok on non-Thor turns

### Erebus

* Put Yukari & Akihiko on Heal/Support, Mitsuru on Act Freely
* Keep Magic Mirrors/Makarakarn up and Thunder Reign/use items on free turns
* Aigis/Yukari being stripped of Makarakarn is mostly fine, you'll definitely want to reapply if Mitsuru/Akihiko lose mirrors or if Aigis & Yukari both lose mirrors
* Swap Akihiko & Yukari to Full Assault during Dark Embrace, Use Ragnarok over Thunder Reign during this phase
* Don't get crit lol
